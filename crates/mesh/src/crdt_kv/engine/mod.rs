//! Namespace CRDT engines.
//!
//! Each namespace (`worker:`, `rl:`, `config:`, ...) is owned by exactly one
//! engine that implements [`NamespaceCrdtEngine`]. The engine owns its live
//! state, metadata, operation log, per-key locks, and logical clock - all the
//! invariants that make its CRDT strategy work.
//!
//! [`crdt::CrdtOrMap`](super::crdt::CrdtOrMap) above this layer is just a
//! router: it matches each key to the right engine by registered prefix and
//! delegates. The router does not know LWW vs EpochMaxWins.
//!
//! This split exists so a new strategy (EpochMaxWins today, future ones later)
//! does not require strategy branches inside every entry point of the shared
//! store - the seam that produced most of the bug class in PR #1469.
